Project Overview This project involves a comprehensive process of cleaning, merging, and analyzing customer, sales, exchange rate, and store data. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide of the workflow followed:

Step 0: Collecting all the files Create folder with all the csv files to run the python file in the same folder Step 1: Data Cleaning Reading the Data: Utilized Python and Pandas to read the CSV files for customers, sales, exchange rates, and stores. Handling Missing Values: Identified and filled null values using appropriate methods. Data Type Conversion: Converted columns to their respective data types (e.g., dates, integers, floats). Step 2: Data Merging Merging Datasets: Merged all cleaned data into a single DataFrame using the Pandas merge function with the inner join method. Step 3: Uploading Data to mySQL Connecting to mySQL Database: Established a connection to the mySQL database using Pymysql. Pushing Data to mySQL: Pushed the cleaned and merged DataFrame to the mySQL database named capstone2. Step 4: Data Analysis with SQL Writing SQL Queries: Created SQL queries to analyze customer, sales, product, and store data. Step 5: Data Visualization with Power BI Uploading Queries: Uploaded the results of each SQL query into Power BI. Creating Visualizations: Created visualizations to present insights from the data analysis.
